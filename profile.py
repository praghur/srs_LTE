### srsLTE Simulated RF

Use this profile to intantiate an end-to-end LTE network using simulated links
between eNB and UE (sending baseband IQ samples back and forth via ZMQ instead
of transmitting over the air via SDRs). Three d430 compute nodes will be
deployed (`epc`, `enb1`, and `rue1`), each with srsLTE 20.04.1, and connected to
the same LAN.

"""

tourInstructions = """

After your experiment becomes ready, login to `epc` via `ssh` and do the
following:

```
/local/repository/start.sh
```

This will start a `tmux` session with two panes. The first one will be running
`srsepc`, while the second can be used to run tests with `ping` or `iperf`.

After `srsepc` is running on `epc`, login to `enb1` and run the same command you
did on `epc`. A `tmux` session will be created with `srsenb` running. You'll see
`srsepc` react to this as some handshaking occurs.

Finally, login to `rue1` and repeat the previous command one last time. This
will start yet another `tmux` session with two panes. The first will be running
`srsue`, while the second can be used to run other commands. `srsue` should sync
with `srsenb`, create a TUN interface called `tun_srsue` and obtain an IP
address. After sync you can ping `srsepc` with:

```
ping 172.16.0.1
```

**Note**: If you are not familiar with `tmux`, it's a terminal multiplexer that has
some similarities to screen. Here's a [tmux cheat sheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com),
but `ctrl-b o` (move to other pane) and `ctrl-b x` (kill pane), should get you
pretty far. `ctrl-b d` will detach you from the `tmux` session and leave it
running in the background. You can reattach with `tmux attach`.

If you'd like to start everything manually, here are the commands:

```
# start srsepc (on epc node)
sudo srsepc /local/repository/etc/epc.conf

# start srsenb (on enb1 node)
sudo srsenb /local/repository/etc/enb.conf

# start srsue (on rue1 node)
sudo srsue /local/repository/etc/ue.conf
```
